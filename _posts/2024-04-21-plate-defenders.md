## Plate Defenders | PC

<div>
    <p><strong>Plate Defenders</strong> is a simple game where all you wanted was to have a nice meal... But you're not the ony one! The insects are coming, so defend your food! Kill the insects before they can take a bite, but don't forget to take bites yourself! Just be careful to not swap the two and bite the insects instead!</p>
    <p>This game was made in 40 hours by me alone for the NUCC-FCUP 2024, managing to finish in 3rd place.</p>
