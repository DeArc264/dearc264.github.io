## The Loop | PC

<strong>The Loop</strong> is a short horror experience about being stuck in the same place, going through the same hallway over and over again... Or is it?
Inspired by Silent Hills P.T., the game features simple puzzles that the player must solve in order to progress until they can escape the hallway.
