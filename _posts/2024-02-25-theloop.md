## About

<div>
  <p><strong>The Loop</strong> is a short horror experience about being stuck in the same place, going through the same hallway over and over again... Or is it?</p>
  <p>Inspired by Silent Hills P.T., the game features simple puzzles that the player must solve in order to progress until they can escape the hallway.</p>
