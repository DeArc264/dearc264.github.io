## Brewing Trouble | PC

<div>
  <p><strong>Brewing Trouble</strong> is game where you will take the role of an alchemist apprentice, and, once again, your teacher had to leave on a travel to the neighbouring country, and now it's up to you to keep business running until he returns. Follow the old recipes, discover new ones, attend requests from the people, but be careful with what kind of requests you accept... Actions have consequences.</p>
  <p>This project started in october 2024 and is still going. At this moment it is still a prototype, but soon will have it's own playable demo.</p>
  <p>Inspired by games such as Potion Craft and Paper's Please, with a little bit of Presentable Liberty. It is focused on crafting and management, with the player having to continue his own research of new potions while the world outside reacts to his choices of interaction with the clients.</p>
